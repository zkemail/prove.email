## Safe Flows

Safe Accounts have come a long way since their release, evolving to meet the changing needs of the ecosystem. The early versions of Safe Accounts marked a significant milestone in multi-signature technology. However, they had some limitations, particularly in terms of gas efficiency and compatibility with newer standards.

With the introduction of ERC-4337, Safe Accounts underwent a significant update. They improved gas efficiency, gained better compatibility with account abstraction, and enhanced flexibility for implementing recovery mechanisms.

These improvements have allowed us to create a simpler recovery solution for our ZK Email Account Recovery.

Our implementation of ZK Email Account Recovery has been designed to adapt to both older and newer Safe Wallet versions:

- **For Safe Wallet:** We implemented the recovery system as a module that can be added to existing Safe Accounts. This allows users of older versions to set up a guardian and enable recovery without needing to migrate their assets.
- **For Burner Safe:** We utilized all the account abstraction capabilities introduced in ERC-4337 and ERC-7579, allowing for a more streamlined integration of the recovery process.

> Note: If you are beginner or dont have a Safe Accou yet, we suggest using the Burner Safe Flow.

## Safe Wallet

### Setting up Your Account with Email Recovery

1. **Create a Safe Wallet**

   Begin by setting up a new Safe wallet. This multi-signature wallet will serve as the foundation for your recoverable account. 
   
   Navigate to the [Safe website](https://app.safe.global/new-safe/create?chain=basesep) and follow their user-friendly process to create your wallet. You'll need to do the following.

   > Note: This demo is intended for Base Sepolia.

   1. **Select network and name of your Safe Wallet**: Write any name to your new Safe Wallet. Then press "Next".
   2. **Signers and confirmations**: By default your wallet will be the single initial owner, press "Next".
   3. **Review**: Select "Pay Now", press "Create" and sign the transaction to create your new Safe Wallet and wait for the confirmation.

   After completing this steps, you have succesfully set created your new Safe.

   Once your Safe is created, you'll need to connect it to the ZK Email recovery system.

   Navigate to [ZK Email Recovery website](https://recovery.prove.email/) and click on "**Safe Wallet Flow**".

   This step integrates the recovery functionality with your Safe.

5. **Set Up Guardian**

   Guardians are trusted individuals who can help you recover your account. On the [recovery.prove.email](https://recovery.prove.email/) interface, you'll find the option to set up the guardian details. 
   
   Enter the email address of your chosen guardian. You'll also be able to configure recovery parameters, such as delay periods or expiration times. These settings add extra layers of security to your recovery process. (For the guide don't modify the parameter).

6. **Sign Transaction and Confirm Guardian**

   To finalize adding a guardian, you'll need to sign a transaction on your Safe. This transaction officially registers the guardian with your account.

## Troubleshooting

- Guardian Email Not Received: Check spam folders, verify the email address, or resend the confirmation.
- Transaction Failing: Ensure you have enough gas fees, check network congestion, or try again later.
- Recovery Process Failed: Verify all steps have been completed, check for any pending confirmations, or contact support. The new address must be different than the previous, recovering to the same address will lead to an error.
