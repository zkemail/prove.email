## ZK Email Updates
We’ve released v6.1.6 of zk-email’s core libraries! This adds:
- DKIM public keys now work on DNS over HTTPS, which allows more consistent browser fetching for sites like proton.me
- constrained regex reveal more tightly to address concerns from our Zellic audit
- added header masking to make masking/whistleblowing applications more robust
- added substring matching, allowing for more efficient matches where regex is not needed

We also have very beta Noir zk-email circuits with Mach34: https://github.com/zkemail/zkemail.nr
- Note that the Noir compiler used is completely unaudited and has several critical bugs, so we recommend usage only in fast client-side proving prototypes!

Our beta registry has more features, but is still in unstable beta (sdk.prove.email): 
- The downloaded project now includes the generated zkeys and .sol files
- Execution now occurs entirely on modal.com, meaning operations can happen in parallel
- Proving defaults to GPU, making proofs ~3x faster

DKIM Archive:
- We have a draft blog post up explaining it at prove.email/blog/archive
- We now support domains with dashes in their DKIM urls, such as pse.dev, and searching a string includes prefixes instead of exact matches now

Account Recovery on Safe:
- The main website now supports the new 1.4.1 safes, via both the UI and the permissionless.js burner wallet flow! Try them out at prove.email/recovery and look at our guide at prove.email/blog/account-recovery
