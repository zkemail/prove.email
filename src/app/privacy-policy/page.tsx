          Privacy Policy for ZK Email <br />
          Effective Date: 10/4/2024 <br /> <br />
          <br />
          ZK Email (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to safeguarding your
          privacy and ensuring that your data remains secure and private when
          using our service. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
          and protect your information when you use ZK Email, a
          privacy-preserving system that allows you to selectively prove the
          sender, receiver, or contents of emails without exposing sensitive
          data. <br />
          <br />
          1. Information We Collect <br />
          ZK Email only processes the specific email data you choose to share
          for proof generation. This includes: <br />
          <br />
          Email Metadata: Sender, receiver, subject line, and timestamp of the
          email you are proving. <br />
          Email Content: Only the specific parts of the email you choose to
          reveal (e.g., Twitter username, mention of a name, etc.). All other
          parts of the email remain private. <br />
          OAuth Authentication: If integrating with third-party email providers
          (e.g., Gmail), ZK Email requests read access to your emails and
          metadata solely to generate proofs. The access scope is strictly
          limited to what&apos;s needed to perform these functions. <br />
          <br />
          2. How We Use Your Data <br />
          ZK Email uses your data exclusively for proof generation. Here&apos;s
          how: <br />
          <br />
          Proof Creation: We enable you to prove the contents of an email while
          concealing the parts you don&apos;t want to disclose. <br />
          Temporary Data Processing: If you choose to generate proofs
          server-side, raw email data is temporarily stored for the duration of
          proof generation and deleted immediately afterward. <br />
          Client-Side Privacy: When generating proofs client-side, no email data
          is stored on our servers. All proof generation happens locally on your
          device. <br />
          <br />
          3. Data Storage and Retention <br />
          Client-Side Processing: ZK Email does not store any data on our
          servers during client-side proof generation. All email data remains on
          your device, ensuring full privacy. <br />
          Server-Side Processing: If server-side proof generation is required,
          raw email data is temporarily processed and stored until the proof is
          generated. After the proof is created, the raw data is immediately
          deleted. The resulting proof may be stored on-chain or off-chain,
          depending on your requirements. <br />
          Analytics: We use privacy-preserving analytics via tinfoil.sh, an MPC
          (Multi-Party Computation) based system that performs analytics without
          storing any individual session data. As a result, ZK Email does not
          require cookie banners or any invasive tracking. <br />
          <br />
          4. Third-Party Access <br />
          ZK Email does not sell or rent your data under any circumstance. We
          share your email data with third parties in the following
          circumstances: <br />
          <br />
          Proof Verification: If the proof needs to be pushed on-chain (e.g., to
          verify email ownership or content), the disclosed data will be
          available on the blockchain, where it will remain immutable. <br />
          Service Providers: We may work with trusted partners (e.g., cloud
          infrastructure providers) to facilitate server-side proof generation.
          These partners are contractually obligated to comply with our privacy
          policies. <br />
          <br />
          5. Security Measures <br />
          We employ robust security measures to protect your data: <br />
          <br />
          Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Our system uses advanced cryptography to ensure
          that only the email content you explicitly reveal is exposed.
          Everything else remains private. <br />
          Encryption: All data transmissions are encrypted, ensuring that any
          email data being transferred is secured. <br />
          Client-Side Proving: For maximum privacy, ZK Email allows users to
          generate proofs entirely on their own device, meaning no data is
          shared with ZK Email servers unless explicitly consented to. <br />
          <br />
          6. Consent and Control <br />
          You have full control over the data ZK Email processes: <br />
          <br />
          OAuth Authorization: If you connect an email provider (e.g., Gmail) to
          ZK Email, we request explicit permission to access only the emails
          required to create proofs. <br />
          Proof Generation Consent: You must manually consent to temporary
          storage of email data if server-side processing is necessary. This is
          clearly indicated in the user interface (UI). <br />
          Blockchain Consent: If you choose to push proofs on-chain, ZK Email
          will prompt for your explicit consent before publishing any
          email-related data on a blockchain. <br />
          <br />
          7. Your Rights <br />
          You have the right to: <br />
          <br />
          Withdraw Access: You can revoke access to your email account at any
          time through the OAuth settings of your email provider. <br />
          Data Deletion: ZK Email will delete any temporary raw email data once
          the proof generation process is complete. We store no personal data
          unless it is explicitly included in a proof you chose to push to the
          blockchain. <br />
          Transparency: You can request information on any data ZK Email has
          processed or stored for proof generation. <br />
          <br />
          8. Changes to This Policy <br />
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are
          made, we will notify users by posting the revised policy on our
          website, and changes will take effect immediately. <br />
          <br />
